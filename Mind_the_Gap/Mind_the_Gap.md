## Mind the Gap 

Oh my god, it has been such a thrilling F1 season. As we enter the last month of races, I think back to the tightest title battles of the last 15 years of so. Three come to mind: Hamilton vs. Massa in 2008 ([what a dramatic ending that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHSeGou-pCI)), Vettel vs. Alonso in 2012, and Rosberg vs. Hamilton in 2016. With championship battles that close, I often think that it comes down to "who wants it more."

With that in mind, another thought popped into my head: [reference-dependent preferences](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20343/w20343.pdf) (shoutout to my Behavioral Economics class!).

My Professor pointed out that while the distribution of Boston Marathon finish times is generally normal, we can see spikes at every half-hour mark, with the 4:00 mark the most prominent... why is this? In short, reference points (i.e. a 4:00 marathon) serve as a goal marker that divides the marathon outcome between the gain domain (sub4:00 marathon) and a loss domain (above 4:00 marathon). With psychological traits such as loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity, there is a spike in utility from crossing from the loss to gain domain at the reference point. In fact, this paper even discusses how toward the end of a race, runners who are comfortably within their goal of a 4:00 marathon will slow down, while runners near the or slightly above the 4:00 marathon are less likely to slow down and in some cases speed up - and that this phenomenon is not attributed to a race strategy of conserving energy but to achieving their goal. (The paper also states that runners who finish the marathon with a time of 4:01 are more likely to run the next year compared to those who finish with a time of 3:59.) I interpret these findings to explain that runners - and other athletes such as F1 drivers - have to some extent psychological control over their performance. I'm sure every athlete has heard their coach say that success in their sport is "90% mental, 10% physical." 

Looking at these close F1 title battles, I wondered if title protagonists drove at a higher level if they were in the "loss domain" and let their foot off the gas (pun intended) if they were in the "gain domain." Even Nico Rosberg admitted that in Abu Dhabi of 2016 his goal was to come away with P2 and seal the championship. With this small analysis, I looked at qualifying performances compared to how far behind the respective driver was in points in the title race. I would expect the driver to perform better in qualifying if they were behind in the title race.

Note: This data wasn't perfect due to engine reliability issues, sessions that were red flagged, and times when the driver simply didn't make Q3. In which case, I looked on a case-by-case basis to give the driver a pseudo-Q3 time.


### 2008

As we can see in the 2008 title race, Lewis Hamilton took the championship lead at around the halfway point of the season and never relinquished the lead, although he fought off a very spirited effort from Felipe Massa in what would turn out to be a title that was won at the last corner of the last race.
