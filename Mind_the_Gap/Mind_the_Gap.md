## Mind the Gap 

Oh my god, it has been such a thrilling F1 season. As we enter the last month of races, I thought back to the tightest title battles of the last 15 years of so. Three come to mind: Hamilton vs. Massa in 2008 ([what a dramatic ending that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHSeGou-pCI)), Vettel vs. Alonso in 2012, and Rosberg vs. Hamilton in 2016. With championship battles that close, I often think that it comes down to "who wants it more."

With that in mind, another thought popped into my head: reference-dependent preferences (shoutout to my Behavioral Economics class!).
